# DataCamp Data Analyst Professional Certificate

This project represents my **solution** for the **DataCamp Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. It demonstrates my ability to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world business problem, using Python tools and statistical methods to derive actionable insights.

## Project: Pens and Printers Sales Strategy Evaluation

### Overview
In this project, I evaluated the effectiveness of three distinct sales strategies used by **Pens and Printers**, a company founded in 1984, for a new line of office stationery. Over a six-week period, the company tested various marketing approaches to determine which sales strategy was most successful based on performance metrics such as sales volume and customer engagement.

This project was a key component of my certification, where I applied my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to deliver data-driven recommendations for the business.
